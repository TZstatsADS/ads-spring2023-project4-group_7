+ Project summary: For this project, our team is assigned specific algorithms from the Machine Learning Fairness literature A3 and A6, which are Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma) and Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS). Our goal was to optimize accuracy and calibration (getting close to an equal percentage of African-Americans and Caucasians being labeled correctly) in determining whether an individual would become a recidivist - a re-offender. 
	

**Contribution statement**: All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. Specifically: 

Jiajun Du worked on the Local Preferential Sampling model and the Local Massing model for the A6, and also organize the group meeting for this project.
 
Fei Xue worked on the function and logistic model in A3 and combine A3 and A6 in testing report.

Ananya Tinaikar worked on cleaning the data and the baseline model for A3.

Kaitlyn Brown worked on optimizing fairness with accuracy constraints in A3.

Renqi Zhang worked on the baseline random forest model in A6.

Yi Sun implemented local Massaging with Renqi for A6 and re-run the baseline model to test the performance.
